The repo contains the various ml_projects notebooks i have worked and explored upon. <br />
Each project description is as under : <br />
**#1**. **Medical_Cost_Prediction** <br />
The repo contains a research paper " **A computational Intelligence Approach for Predicting Medical Insurance Cost** " renamed as mcp.pdf and a notebook file which is an implementation of the paper in ML domain. <br />

The paper summary is as follows : Using a series of machine learning algorithms, this study provides a computational intelligence approach for predicting healthcare insurance costs.  <br />
The proposed research approach uses Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Ridge Regressor, Stochastic Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Random Forest Regressor, Multiple Linear Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors  <br />
A medical insurance cost dataset is acquired from the KAGGLE repository for this purpose, and machine learning methods are used to show how different regression models can forecast insurance costs and to compare the modelsâ€™ accuracy. +e results shows that the Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) model outperforms the others with a cross-validation value of 0.0.858 and RMSE value of 0.340 and gives 86% accuracy.
